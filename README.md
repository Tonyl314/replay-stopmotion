# replay-stopmotion
A tool for creating stopmotion animations in games with a replay system.
## How to download
There are two options:
- run it from the source (remember to `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- run the executables (use the *_Executables.zip*)
**Optional**: if you want to join the frames into a video automatically, download [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) and add it to the PATH
## How to use
You can watch a tutorial on how to animate in SpyParty [here](https://youtu.be/_QvfzZY4tzI).
To make an animation, first run the *Capturer* to capture the timings of the individual frames in real-time. Then go to the replay and let the *Recorder* take the pictures. To convert them into a video, use editing software of your choice or FFMPEG.
