# replay-stopmotion
 A tool for creating stopmotion animations in games with a replay system.
 To make an animation, first run `capturer.py` to capture the timings of individual frames in real-time. Then go to the replay and let `recorder.py` take the pictures. If you have [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed, you can also convert them into a video with a single button press.
